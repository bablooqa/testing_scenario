1. Set Up  Environment
Install Dependencies:
   pip install selenium pytest pytest-selenium
   
2. Download WebDriver:
Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome) and ensure it's in your system's PATH.

4. Execute the tests using Pytest:
   pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q




# Testing Scenario

## Here’s a simple approach:

Automating Authentication Flow Testing
1. Set Up the Environment
Install Selenium WebDriver: Choose a programming language (e.g., Python, Java) and install the Selenium WebDriver for that language.
Install Testing Framework: Use a testing framework like Pytest for Python or Selenium.
2. Create Test Scripts
Registration Tests:
Write scripts to automate registration with valid and invalid inputs.
Verify that registration confirmation emails are sent (use an email testing tool if needed).
Login Tests:
Write scripts to automate login with valid and invalid credentials.
Test password reset functionality by automating the process and verifying the new password.
Google Sign-In Tests:
Use Selenium to interact with Google’s OAuth authentication.
Handle pop-ups and automate the login process using Google’s API or test credentials.
Social Login Tests:
Write scripts for signing in using various social media accounts.
Automate scenarios where social login is canceled or fails.
3. Run the Tests
Execute Test Scripts: Run the automated tests using your chosen testing framework.
Monitor and Record Results: Check the test results to ensure all scenarios pass. Use tools like Allure Report or Extent Reports for detailed reporting.
4. Handle Test Data and Environment
Data Management: Use test data management tools or create scripts to handle test data setup and cleanup.
Environment Setup: Ensure your test environment mirrors the production environment to catch environment-specific issues.
5. Continuous Integration
Integrate with CI/CD: Add your tests to a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions. This allows tests to run automatically with each build.
